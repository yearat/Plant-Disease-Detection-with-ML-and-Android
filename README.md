# Plant-Disease-Detection-with-ML-and-Android
A small project where I trained mobilenetV2 with transfer learning on specific plant leaves and  deployed as android application.

The following project was developed as my university Junior Design project.

Here we used [PlantVillage](https://www.kaggle.com/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset) dataset to choose our specific leaves data.
We used transfer learning method on [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381) which was pre trained on [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/) dataset. 
Then we saved the model as TFlite model and deployed it on an android application built with Flutter.
